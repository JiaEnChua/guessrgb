# Color Guessing Game
Visit at: https://guessrgb.herokuapp.com/

## Introduction
  This project serves as a RGB-recognizing game for user to train their familiarity with RGB values. There are two modes for user to choose. Beginner can choose easy mode while others with more confidence can choose hard mode. This project is created by using various front end web development tools like HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

## Lessons Learned
  In the process of building this project, I have gained quite some knowledge about DOM manipulation and selection in JS. A lot of powerful features in JS such as eventlistener, classList, setAttribute, textContent, innerHTML were used in this project. I have also familiarized myself with how HTML tags should work together with CSS and JS to create something interesting and useful. Also, I learned to refactor code and write DRY code which improves my programming skill in general.
